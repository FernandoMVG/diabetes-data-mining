        <h2>Project Justification</h2>
        <p>
            We selected the "Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008" dataset due to its comprehensive representation of diabetes care across 130 U.S. hospitals over a decade. This makes it ideal for developing predictive models and identifying relevant patterns for clinical diabetes management. Diabetes, a prevalent chronic condition, significantly impacts public health, making effective hospital management crucial to prevent complications that can lead to readmissions, increasing both morbidity and healthcare costs. By focusing on readmissions within 30 days of discharge, this dataset is essential for reducing readmission rates, improving patient outcomes, and optimizing healthcare resources.
            </p><p>
            The dataset enables us to analyze how treatment decisions and demographic characteristics affect readmissions, providing valuable insights for developing improved treatment protocols and enhancing patient quality of life. Analyzing this data can contribute to better diabetes management, optimize clinical outcomes, and reduce unnecessary readmissions, thereby facilitating the creation of personalized treatment plans.
            </p>

        <h2>Project Relevance</h2>
        <p>
            The chosen dataset aligns perfectly with our project goals, focusing on understanding factors influencing early readmission among diabetic patients. It includes variables such as patient demographics (age, gender, race), clinical variables (HbA1c results, number of medications, type of diabetes), and healthcare process variables (length of stay, admission type, medical specialty of the admitting physician). These provide a comprehensive view of patient health and care received.<br><br>
            Similar datasets have been used in research to explore healthcare outcomes. For instance, the study <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-021-01423-y">"The 30-days hospital readmission risk in diabetic patients: predictive modeling with machine learning classifiers"</a> by Yujuan Shang et al. predicted early readmissions using machine learning techniques and identified key risk factors. Their findings highlight the importance of demographic and treatment-related factors in predicting readmissions.<br><br>
            Another study, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360020262_An_Interpretable_Intelligent_Model_for_Predicting_Readmission_Risk_Features_in_Diabetes_Patients">"An Interpretable Intelligent Model for Predicting Readmission Risk Features in Diabetes Patients"</a>, focused on creating a machine learning model that predicts readmission rates and emphasizes interpretability. It found that the number of inpatient admissions and emergency visits were critical factors in predicting readmissions, highlighting the value of interpretable models in healthcare.

        <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
      
        <p>The instances in this dataset represent individual patient records of hospitalized patients diagnosed with diabetes. These records capture patient and hospital outcomes derived from encounters that met specific criteria:</p>
      
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inpatient encounters:</strong> Hospital admissions with a length of stay between 1 and 14 days.</li>
          <li><strong>Diabetic encounters:</strong> Cases where diabetes was diagnosed during the hospitalization.</li>
          <li><strong>Lab and medication administration:</strong> The presence of laboratory tests and medication administration during the encounter.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Data Attributes</h3>
      
        <p>The data encompasses a range of attributes, including:</p>
      
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Patient demographics:</strong> Patient number, race, gender, and age.</li>
          <li><strong>Admission details:</strong> Admission type, length of stay, and admitting physician's medical specialty.</li>
          <li><strong>Laboratory information:</strong> Number of lab tests performed and HbA1c test result.</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnoses:</strong> Primary and secondary diagnoses.</li>
          <li><strong>Medication data:</strong> Total number of medications, diabetic medications, and medication types.</li>
          <li><strong>Previous encounters:</strong> Number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits within the year prior to hospitalization.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The distinction between inpatient and outpatient encounters is clarified: inpatient encounters involve hospitalization for one or more days, while outpatient encounters do not require hospitalization.</p>

        <h2>Data Cleaning Process</h2>
        <p><strong>Setting a threshold:</strong> A value named "threshold" is defined. This value represents the maximum allowable percentage of missing values within a column. If a column exceeds this threshold, it will be removed.</p>
        <p><strong>Calculating the proportion of missing values:</strong> The proportion of missing values for each column in the dataset is computed. This indicates the percentage of empty values in each column.</p>
        <p><strong>Removing columns with excessive missing values:</strong> The calculated proportions are compared to the threshold. Columns that surpass the threshold (i.e., have more missing values than allowed) are eliminated from the dataset.</p>
        <p><strong>Reporting removed columns:</strong> The code displays a list of the columns that have been removed, providing insight into the information lost during the cleaning process.</p>
