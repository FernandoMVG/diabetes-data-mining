        <h2>Project Justification</h2>
        <p>
            We selected the "Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008" dataset because it offers a comprehensive representation of diabetes care across 130 U.S. hospitals over a decade, making it a solid foundation for developing predictive models and finding patterns that help us to obtain valuable insights related to clinical care for diabetes patterns.
            Diabetes is a prevalent and chronic condition with profound implications for public health. Effective management of diabetes in hospital settings is crucial, as failure to provide appropriate care can lead to complications that require readmission, increasing both patient morbidity and healthcare costs. The dataset's focus on early readmission within 30 days of discharge is crucial as reducing readmission rates is a key objective for improving patient outcomes, quality of life and optimizing healthcare resources. This dataset allows us to analyze how treatment decisions and patient demographics impact readmission, providing insights that could guide better treatment protocols, lower readmission rates, enhancing patient care and quality of life.
            With the information that this dataset allows us to obtain, this project could contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve diabetes care management, enhance patient outcomes, and reduce the burden of unnecessary hospital readmissions. The insights gained from this analysis could be applied to develop targeted and personalized treatment plans, which are increasingly important in modern healthcare.

        <h2>Project Relevance</h2>
        <p>
            The chosen dataset aligns perfectly with our project goals, which are centered on understanding the factors that may influence early readmission among diabetic patients. The dataset includes a wide range of variables that are directly relevant to this objective, such as patient demographics (age, gender, race), clinical variables (HbA1c test results, number of medications, type of diabetes), and healthcare process variables (length of stay, admission type, medical specialty of the admitting physician). These variables provide a comprehensive view of the patient's health status and the care they received.
This type of dataset has been used in various studies and research projects with similar use-cases in order to explore healthcare outcomes of the same kind. For example, In the study titled "The 30-days hospital readmission risk in diabetic patients: predictive modeling with machine learning classifiers," Yujuan Shang and colleagues aimed to predict the likelihood of early readmissions among diabetic patients using various machine learning techniques. The researchers employed a large dataset of hospitalized diabetic patients, focusing on the identification of key risk factors associated with readmission, they were able to build predictive models in order to identify high-risk patients. Their findings indicated that specific demographic and treatment-related factors played crucial roles in predicting early readmissions, you can find more details about this study here: <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-021-01423-y">The 30-days hospital readmission risk in diabetic patients: predictive modeling with machine learning classifiers</a>. 
In the study "An Interpretable Intelligent Model for Predicting Readmission Risk Features in Diabetes Patients" the researchers used data of diabetes patients clinical care for building a machine learning model that not only predicts readmission rates accurately and gives insight on risk factors but also strongly emphasizes on the interpretability of the results. While many machine learning approaches are powerful, they often lack transparency, making it difficult for healthcare professionals to understand and trust the predictions and insights this model could provide. Their analysis revealed that the number of inpatient admissions and emergency visits in a year were the most critical factors influencing the likelihood of readmission. This study demonstrates the value of interpretable machine learning models, you can read more about the study here: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360020262_An_Interpretable_Intelligent_Model_for_Predicting_Readmission_Risk_Features_in_Diabetes_Patients">An Interpretable Intelligent Model for Predicting Readmission Risk Features in Diabetes Patients</a>.
