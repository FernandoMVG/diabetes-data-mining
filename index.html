        <h2>Project Justification</h2>
        <p>
            We selected the "Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008" dataset due to its comprehensive representation of diabetes care across 130 U.S. hospitals over a decade. This makes it ideal for developing predictive models and identifying relevant patterns for clinical diabetes management. Diabetes, a prevalent chronic condition, significantly impacts public health, making effective hospital management crucial to prevent complications that can lead to readmissions, increasing both morbidity and healthcare costs. By focusing on readmissions within 30 days of discharge, this dataset is essential for reducing readmission rates, improving patient outcomes, and optimizing healthcare resources.
            </p><p>
            The dataset enables us to analyze how treatment decisions and demographic characteristics affect readmissions, providing valuable insights for developing improved treatment protocols and enhancing patient quality of life. Analyzing this data can contribute to better diabetes management, optimize clinical outcomes, and reduce unnecessary readmissions, thereby facilitating the creation of personalized treatment plans.
            </p>

        <h2>Project Relevance</h2>
        <p>
            The chosen dataset aligns perfectly with our project goals, focusing on understanding factors influencing early readmission among diabetic patients. It includes variables such as patient demographics (age, gender, race), clinical variables (HbA1c results, number of medications, type of diabetes), and healthcare process variables (length of stay, admission type, medical specialty of the admitting physician). These provide a comprehensive view of patient health and care received.<br><br>
            Similar datasets have been used in research to explore healthcare outcomes. For instance, the study <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-021-01423-y">"The 30-days hospital readmission risk in diabetic patients: predictive modeling with machine learning classifiers"</a> by Yujuan Shang et al. predicted early readmissions using machine learning techniques and identified key risk factors. Their findings highlight the importance of demographic and treatment-related factors in predicting readmissions.<br><br>
            Another study, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360020262_An_Interpretable_Intelligent_Model_for_Predicting_Readmission_Risk_Features_in_Diabetes_Patients">"An Interpretable Intelligent Model for Predicting Readmission Risk Features in Diabetes Patients"</a>, focused on creating a machine learning model that predicts readmission rates and emphasizes interpretability. It found that the number of inpatient admissions and emergency visits were critical factors in predicting readmissions, highlighting the value of interpretable models in healthcare.
